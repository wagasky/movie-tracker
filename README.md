This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## About:

This project was completed with my partners Michelle Hoffman and Natalie Montoya as part of the front-end curriculum at The Turing School. It allows any user to see current movies. The movie data comes from the Movie DB API. When the user creates an account and logs in, they have the ability to favorite movies and see all of their favorited movies on the Favorites page.

This was our first time implementing React Router, our first time using Redux, and our first time posting information to a backend database! We learned so much on this project.

Technologies used: React, Router, Redux, communicating with backend API (get and post requests), JavaScript, SCSS
